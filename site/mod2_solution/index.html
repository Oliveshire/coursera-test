<h1>All Star Lyrics</h1>

  <div class="col-d-4 col-t-6 col-m-12" id="container">
    <p class="topRight" id="blue">First</p>
    <p>
      Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me<br>
      I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
      She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb<br>
      In the shape of an "L" on her forehead<br>
      Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
      Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
      Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
      Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
      So much to do, so much to see<br>
      So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?<br>
      You'll never know if you don't go<br>
      You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>
      Hey now, you're an all star<br>
      Get your game on, go play<br>
      Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
      Get the show on, get paid<br>
      And all that glitters is gold<br>
      Only shooting stars break the mold

  <div class="col-d-4 col-t-6 col-m-12" id="container">
    <p class="topRight" id="yellow">Second</p>
    <p>
      It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder<br>
      You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older<br>
      But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
      Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>
      The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
      The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br>
      My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?<br>
      That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored<br>
      Hey now, you're an all star<br>
      Get your game on, go play<br>
      Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
      Get the show on, get paid<br>
      All that glitters is gold<br>
      Only shooting stars break the mold<br>
      Somebody once asked<br>
      Could I spare some change for gas?<br>
      "I need to get myself away from this place"<br>
      I said, "Yep, what a concept<br>
      I could use a little fuel myself<br>
      And we could all use a little change"
    </p>

      Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>

      Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
      So much to do, so much to see<br>
      So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?<br>
      You'll never know if you don't go (go!)<br>
      You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>
      Hey now, you're an all star<br>
