      <p id="Chicken"> Chicken </p>
      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a little chicken, and everybody called him-- Chicken Little.
        And one day while he was out walking, up in the sky a bird flew over and it dropped an acorn, and the acorn fell
        down and-- bip-- bopped him on his head.
        Chicken Little said “AWK! ” and looked up, and didn’t see anything, and he looked down and didn’t see anything.
        So he said
        “Help, help the sky is falling! Help, help the sky is falling! I have to tell the King!” And he went running down
        the road, looking for the King.
        As he was running he met Henny Penny. And Henny Penny said, “Buk Buk Buk BUK! Hello Chicken LIttle.
        What’s wrong with you?”
        And Chicken Little said, “Oh Henny Penny! Haven’t you heard-- the sky is falling! I’m looking for the King.”
        And Henny Penny said, “Oh my, how exciting. Buk buk buk BUK! Can I go too?” And they went down the road
        together, shouting
        “Help, help the sky is falling! Help, help the sky is falling! We have to tell the King!”
        After awhile they met Goosey Loosey. “Honk! Honk! Hello Chicken Little, Hello Henny Penny. What’s wrong
        with you?”
        “Oh, Goosey Loosey, haven’t you heard? The sky is falling! We have to tell the King!”
        “Honk Honk! That’s terrible! Honk honk. Can I go too?” And they all went down the road together shouting
        “Help, help the sky is falling! Help, help the sky is falling! We have to tell the King!”
        And along the road, they met Turkey Lurkey.
        And Turkey Lurkey said
        “Gobble gobble gobble! Hello Chicken Little, Hello Henny Penny, Hello Goosey Loosey. What in the world is
        wrong with you?”
        “Oh, Turkey Lurkey. Haven’t you heard? The sky is falling! The sky is falling! We’re looking for the King!”
        “Gobble gobble gobble! Oh that’s terrible! Can I go too?”
        And they all went down the road saying 
        “Help, help the sky is falling! Help, help the sky is falling! We have to tell the King!”
        And they went down the road, and they met Foxey Loxey. And Foxey Loxey said, “Hello, Chicken
        Little, Hello Henny Penny, Hello Goosey Loosey. What in the world is wrong with you?”
        And they told him, “Oh, Foxey Loxey, haven’t you heard? The sky is falling! We have to tell the King!”
        “Nothing easier,” said Foxey Loxey. “He’s back there in my den. But the King doesn’t like to feel crowded, so I’d better bring you in one by one. Now, who wants to go first?”
        Everybody wanted to be first to see the King, but the Turkey was the biggest. “Gobble gobble gobble.
        Me first! I want to see the King!” and he pushed everybody else away. “Come with me,” says Foxey
        Loxey, and they went into the hole together.
        Then there was a lot of squawking down there, and some feathers came flying out, and the fox called
        up, “NEXT”
        “Honk Honk. Me! I want to go! Me” said Goosey Loosey, and she pushed her way in. More squawking, more feathers, and the fox said “NEXT!”
        “Buk buk buk BUK!” said Henny Penny, and she jumped in the hole. Squawks, feathers, and
        then............ no sound at all.
        Right then, Chicken Little remembered it was his turn to take the garbage out, and he went home.
        So poor Chicken Little never got to see the King.

        Little Bobby was the only son of a small
        farmer who lived out of town upon a
        country road. Bobby’s mother looked after
        the house and his father took care of the
        farm. Bobby himself, who was not very big,
        helped them both as much as he was able.
        It was lonely upon the farm, especially
        when his father and mother were both busy
        at work, but the boy had one way to amuse
        himself that served to pass many an hour
        when he would not otherwise have known
        what to do. He was very fond of music, and
        his father one day brought him from the
        town a small fiddle, or violin, which he soon
        learned to play upon. I don’t suppose he
        was a very fine musician,
        but the tunes he played
        pleased himself, as well
        as his father and
        mother, and Bobby’s
        fiddle soon became his
        constant companion.
        One day in the
        warm summer the farmer
        and his wife determined to drive
        to the town to sell their butter
        and eggs and bring back some groceries in
        exchange for them. While they were gone
        Bobby was to be left alone.
        “We shall not be back till late in the
        evening,” said his mother, “for the weather is
        too warm to drive very fast. But I have left
        you a dish of bread and milk for your
        supper. Be a good boy and amuse yourself
        with your fiddle until we return.”
        Bobby promised to be good and look
        after the house, and then his father and
        mother drove away to the town.
        The boy was not entirely alone, for there
        was the big black tabby cat lying upon the
        floor in the kitchen, and the little yellow
        dog barking at the wagon as it drove away,
        and the big moolie cow lowing in the
        pasture down by the brook. Animals are
        often very good company, and Bobby did
        not feel nearly as lonely as he would had
        there been no living thing about the house.
        Besides he had some work to do in the
        garden, pulling up the weeds that grew
        thick in the carrot bed. When the last faint
        sounds of the wheels had died away he
        went into the garden and began his task.
        The little dog went too, for dogs love to
        be with people and to watch what is going
        on. He sat down near Bobby and cocked up
        his ears and wagged his tail, and seemed to
        take a great interest in Bobby’s task of
        weeding. Once in a while he would rush
        away to chase a butterfly or bark at a
        beetle that crawled through the garden,
        but he always came back to the boy and
        stayed near his side.
        By and by the cat, which found it lonely
        in the big, empty kitchen, now that Bobby’s
        mother was gone, came walking into the
        garden also, and lay down in the sunshine
        and lazily watched the boy at his work. The
        dog, Towser, and the cat were good friends,
        having lived together so long that they did
        not care to fight each other.
        By the time the carrot bed was weeded,
        the sun was sinking behind the edge of the
        forest and the new moon rising in the east.
        Bobby began to feel hungry and went into
        the house for his dish of bread and milk.
        “I’ll take my supper down to the brook,”
        he said to himself, “and sit upon the bank.
        And I’ll take my fiddle, too, to pass the time
        until Father and Mother come home.”
        Bobby took his fiddle under his arm and
        carried the dish of bread and milk down to
        the bank. He sat upon the edge and, placing
        his fiddle beside him, leaned against a tree
        and began to eat his supper.
        The little dog had followed at his heels,
        and the cat also came slowly walking after
        him. As Bobby ate, they sat one on either
        side of him and looked as if they too were
        hungry. So he threw some of the bread to
        Towser, who swallowed it in the twinkling
        of an eye. Bobby left some milk in the dish
        for the cat, and she came lazily up and
        drank it in a dainty, sober fashion.
        Then Bobby picked up his fiddle and
        began to play some of the pretty tunes he
        knew. As he played he watched the moon
        rise higher and higher until it was reflected
        in the water of the brook. Indeed, Bobby
        could not tell which was the plainest to see,
        the moon in the sky or in the water.
        The little dog lay quietly on one side of
        him, and the cat softly purred upon the
        other. Even the moolie cow was attracted
        by the music and wandered near.
        After a time, when Bobby had played all
        the tunes he knew, he laid the fiddle down
        beside him, near to where the cat slept, and
        then he lay down and began to think.
        Very soon Bobby’s eyes closed and he
        forgot all about the dog and the cat and the
        cow and the fiddle, and dreamed he was
        Jack the Giant Killer and was just about to
        slay the biggest giant in the world.
        While he dreamed, the cat sat up and
        stretched herself, and then began wagging
        her long tail, watching the moon that was
        reflected in the water.
        But the fiddle lay just behind her, and as
        she moved her tail, she drew it between the
        strings, where it caught fast. Then she gave
        her tail a jerk and pulled the fiddle against
        the tree, which made a loud noise. This
        frightened the cat and she started to run.
        But still the fiddle clung to her tail, and at
        every step it made such a noise that she
        screamed with terror.
        In her fright she ran straight towards the
        cow, which, seeing a black streak coming at
        her and hearing the racket made by the
        fiddle, also became frightened and made
        such a jump to get out of the way that she
        leapt right across the brook, over the very
        spot where the moon shone in the water!
        Bobby had been awakened by the noise,
        and opened his eyes to see the cow jump. At
        first it seemed that she had actually jumped
        over the moon in the sky.
        The little dog laughed to see such fun
        caused by the cat, and ran barking and
        dancing along the bank, so that he knocked
        the dish. It slid down the bank, carrying the
        spoon with it, and the dish ran away with
        the spoon into the water of the brook.
        Bobby, recovered from his surprise, ran
        after the cat, which had raced to the house,
        and soon came to where the fiddle lay, it
        having at last dropped from the cat’s tail.
        Then he had to go across the brook and
        drive the cow back over the bridge, and roll
        up his sleeve to recover the dish and the
        spoon from the water.
        Then he went back to the house, and sat
        down to while away the time before his
        parents returned by composing a new tune

        At this time another prophet, named Jonah, was giving the word of the Lord to the Israelites. To Jonah the Lord spoke, saying:
        "Go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it; for its wickedness rises up before me."

        But Jonah did not wish to preach to the people of Nineveh; for they were the enemies of his land, the land of Israel. He wished Nineveh to die in its sins, and not to turn to God and live. So Jonah tried to go away from the city where God had sent him. He went down to Joppa and took a ship for Tarshish.

        But the Lord saw Jonah on the ship; and the Lord sent a great storm upon the sea, so that the ship seemed as though it would go to pieces. The sailors threw overboard everything on the ship; and when they could do no more, every man prayed to his god to save the ship and themselves. Jonah was now lying fast asleep, and the ship's captain came to him, and said:

        "What do you mean by sleeping in such a time as this? Awake, rise up, and call upon your God. Perhaps He will hear you and save our lives."

        But the storm continued to rage around the ship; and they said:

        "There is some man on this ship who has brought upon us this trouble. Let us cast lots and find who it is."

        Then they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. They said to him, all at once:

        "Tell us, who are you? From what country do you come? What is your business? To what people do you belong? Why have you brought all this trouble upon us?"

        Then Jonah told them the whole story, how he came from the land of Israel, and that he had fled away from the presence of the Lord. And they said to him:

        "What shall we do to you, that the storm may cease?"

        Then said Jonah:

        "Take me up and throw me into the sea; then the storm will cease and the waters will be calm; for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you."

        But the men were not willing to throw Jonah into the sea. They rowed hard to bring the ship to the land, but they could not. Then they cried unto the Lord, and said:

        "We pray thee, O Lord, we pray thee, let us not die for this man's life; for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee."

        At last, when they could do nothing else to save themselves, they threw Jonah into the sea.

        At once the storm ceased, and the waves became still. Then the men on the ship feared the Lord greatly. They offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and made promises to serve him.

        And the Lord caused a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was alive within the fish for three days and three nights. In the fish Jonah cried to the Lord; and the Lord caused the great fish to throw up Jonah upon the dry land.

        Notice all through this story that, although Jonah was God's servant, he was always thinking about himself. God protected Jonah and saved him, not because he was such a good man, but because he wanted to teach him a great lesson.

        By this time Jonah had learned that some men who worshipped idols were kind in their hearts, and were dear to the Lord. This was the lesson that God meant Jonah to learn; and now the call of the Lord came to Jonah a second time:

        "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it what I command you." So Jonah went to the city of Nineveh; and as he entered into it, he called out to the people:

        "Within forty days shall Nineveh be destroyed."

        And he walked through the city all day crying out only this:

        "Within forty days shall Nineveh be destroyed."

        And the people of Nineveh believed the word of the Lord as spoken by Jonah. They turned away from their sins and fasted and sought the Lord, from the greatest of them even to the least. The king of Nineveh arose from his throne, and laid aside his royal robes, and covered himself with sack-cloth and sat in ashes, as a sign of his sorrow. And the king sent out a command to his people that they should fast, and seek the Lord, and turn from sin.

        [Illustration: To shade Jonah from the sun]

        And God saw that the people of Nineveh were sorry for their wickedness, and he forgave them, and did not destroy their city. But this made Jonah very angry. He did not wish to have Nineveh spared, because it was the enemy of his own land; and also he feared that men would call him a false prophet when his word did not come to pass. And Jonah said to the Lord:

        "O Lord, I was sure that it would be thus, that thou wouldest spare the city; and for that reason I tried to flee away; for I know that thou wast a gracious God, full of pity, slow to anger, and rich in mercy. Now, O Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live."

        And Jonah went out of the city, and built a little hut on the east side of it, and sat under its roof, to see whether God would keep the word that he had spoken. Then the Lord caused a plant with thick leaves to grow up, and to shade Jonah from the sun; and Jonah was glad, and sat under its shadow. But a worm destroyed the plant; and the next day a hot wind blew, and Jonah suffered from the heat; and again Jonah wished that he might die. And the Lord said to Jonah:

        "You were sorry to see the plant die, though you did not make it grow, and though it came up in a night and died in a night. And should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, where are more than a hundred thousand little children, and also many cattle, -- all helpless and knowing nothing?"

        And Jonah learned that men, and women, and little children, are all precious in the sight of the Lord, even though they know not God.
